# Insomnia
> Keeps your Windows machine awake

## Use
Build the application using the *Release* configuration in Visual Studio.

The executable, *Insomnia.exe*, can be found in *bin/Release*.

Use the executable in that location, create a shortcut, or copy it to another location.

Insomnia will create a system tray (notification area) icon when it is started.

The context menu (right click) can be used to disable ("Allow sleep") and enable ("No sleeping") Insomnia, and to terminate ("Exit") the application.
